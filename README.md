## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a custom assembler and simulator for an ISA as part of the CSE 112 Computer Organization assignment at IIIT Delhi.<br>
The Assembler is written in C, while the Simulator is written in Python.


## Project/Repository Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `Simple-Assembler/`: Contains the implementation of the custom assembler.
- `SimpleSimulator/`: Contains the implementation of the custom simulator.
- `automatedTesting/`: Automated testing scripts written in Python to be run on Linux only.

## Assembler
The assembler is responsible for translating the provided assembly instructions into machine code that can be executed by the simulator. It processes a text file containing assembly instructions, labels, and variable definitions. The assembler follows a specific grammar for the supported instructions and generates the corresponding binary code.

### Assembler Features
- Supports parsing of assembly instructions, labels, and variable definitions.
- Translates assembly instructions into machine code based on the defined ISA.
- Handles error cases such as invalid instructions, undefined labels, and variable definitions.

## Simulator
The simulator emulates the execution of the machine code generated by the assembler. It simulates the behavior of the ISA, including the execution of instructions, memory operations, and register file interactions. The simulator prints a trace of the program execution and allows for testing the functionality of the assembled code.

### Simulator Features
- Emulates the behavior of the defined ISA, including memory operations and register file interactions.
- Prints a trace of the program execution, including the state of the program counter (PC) and register file (RF) at each step.
- Supports testing of the functionality of the assembled code through program execution and trace analysis.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `Simple-Assembler/` or `SimpleSimulator/` directory based on the component you want to work on.
3. Run assembler.c inside `Simple-Assembler/` directory to run the Assembler.
4. Run main.py inside `SimpleSimulator/` directory to run the Simulator.
